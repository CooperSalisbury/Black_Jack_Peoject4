My Project is a game of BlackJack where their will be a human player and a AI dealer. The aim of the game is to get your cards total to 21 without going over and you win if either the dealer goes over 21 or has a lower score than you and the dealer wins if you go over 21 or the dealer has a higher score than you. There are cards 2-10 which equal their respective values, however there is the Ace card which equals 1 and the King, Queen, and Jack which equal 10. You can hit to draw another card at random or stand if you don't want to draw anymore cards. Once the game is over press Play again if you want to keep playing or exit out if you don't.
